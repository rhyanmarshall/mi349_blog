    <h2>Lions Game!</h2>
    <p>I wasn’t a huge football fan growing up. That changed when my younger brother was born and immediately loved it. He and my dad always played together, and he turned out to be a natural. Soon, he became a big fan of the NFL and the Lions. He knew the entire Lions roster and teams from every other city too. This was also right when the Lions were starting to get good, which made it super exciting to watch.

I would go to my brother’s little league games and have my mom explain what was happening. Slowly, I began to learn, but it’s honestly a complicated sport. Growing up a competitive dancer, I didn’t know much about sports at all. Still, once I started to understand, watching became fun.

Eventually, I began going out with my friends on game days for Lions and MSU games. The environment is always so lively—a sense of community with everyone cheering for the same thing, which is rare these days. Over time, I became somewhat of a football fan myself, especially for the Lions.

Since I was home this weekend, I watched the game with my brother and sister. It’s always fun to watch and spend time with family. Here's a table of how the game went today -
