    <p>Hi there, my name is Rhyan Marshall. I am currently attending Michigan State as a senior studying Information Science and Information Technology. I'm from White Lake Michigan, about an hour away from East Lansing, and I come from a big family that I love very much. I also grew up dancing competitively and have enjoyed dance teaching these past years after graduating high school.
