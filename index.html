        <p>I use Fridays as my day to regroup after a busy week, catch up on some things, and get myself ahead to enjoy my weekend. So this weekend I did just that. On Friday I... </p>
        <ol am>
            <li>had a slow morning - let myself sleep in until 9:00, made coffee, and cleaned up my house - I always pick up the house first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>got ready for the day and went to Foster Coffee Co. - I love going here to get work done!</li>
            <li>got there around 11:30 and did work until about 2:30</li>
            <li>went to the gym - Planet Fitness ftw</li>
            <li>walked for about 30 minutes and did some strength excercises - I love using YouTube videos for arm and ab workouts</li>
            <li>went home around 5:00 and made food</li>
            <li>spent the afternoon relaxing and hanging out with my roomates - definitely fell asleep on the couch for like an hour</li>
            <li>started to get ready for the night around 7:00! (best part of the day obviously)</li>
            <li>showered, did my hair and makeup, then picked out an outfit</li>
            <li>went out with my roomates and some of our other friends! we had a fun night, I didn't want it to end</li>
        </ol>
        <p>But of course it did. I woke up around 8:30 on Saturday to my roomate asking to walk to get coffee. Obviously, I couldn't turn it down, so after getting out of bed I...</p>
        <ol pm>
            <li>walked to the Graduate where my roomate and I got coffee - actually an iced pumpkin chai which is phonomenal</li>
            <li>came back and made breakfast sandwiches then cleaned up from the night before</li>
            <li>drove home to White Lake (where I'm from) around 1:00</li>
            <li>helped my sister get ready for her senior homecoming!</li>
            <li>went to their pictures with my mom and sister, I caught up with some old friends and parents</li>
            <li>then came home for the night and had a wonderful Saturday night in</li>
        </ol>
